Step 1 :

If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 11906:localhost:11906 oem214@greene.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host, 
that you can directly login to greene with command

ssh oem214@greene

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 11906:localhost:11906 oem214@greene

Step 2:

Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with

The Jupyter Notebook is running at: cm06.nyu.cluster

the URL is something: http://localhost:11906/?token=XXXXXXXX (see your token below)

you should be able to connect to jupyter notebook running remotly on greene compute node with above url
